### Windows 8.1/10 ###

<Notes>
The following instructions assume that we will use a C++ compiler associated with Visual Studio.
Thus, you need to install C++ components on Visual Studio if you haven't done it yet.
Also you may need to update the C++ components in order to install an appropriate version of the compiler.  

1. Download a sample C++ program (.cpp file) for running a RealSense camera along with a CMake script (CMakeLists.txt) from https://github.com/ToshiEAB
Note: You need to change the version number "2.10.3" in CMakeLists.txt if you use a different version of RealSense SDK 2.0

2. Make a new folder with the name of your preference somewhere on computer (e.g., C:/sample) and save both of the .cpp and CMakeList.txt files in this folder
Note: Let's call this folder "sample folder" hereafter.

3. In the sample folder, make a new folder named "build"

4. Run cmake-gui.exe
Note: This file is located in the CMake folder.

5. Click the "Browse Source..." button and select the opencv folder  (e.g., C:/sample) 

6. Click the "Browse Build..." button and select the build folder  (e.g., C:/sample/build)

7. Click the "Configure" button

8. Select an appropriate generator (e.g., "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" for a 64-bit OS. "14" means Visual Studio 2015. Check the appropriate number for the version you have.)
Note: Enter "host=x64" under "Optional toolset to use" to allow for the maximum capacity of RAM

9. Click the "Finish" button
Note: After configuration, an error may show up if the Environment Variable named "OpenCV_DIR" is not set correctly (see "How to build OpenCV.txt")

10. Click the "Generate" button 

11. Run RealSense.sln located in the build folder
Note: Wait for a minute until parcing completes

12. Change the configuration mode from "Debug" to "Release"

13. Under "Solution Explorer", right-click "RealSense" and then click "Set as StartUp Project"

14. Build the programs: "Build" tab --> "Build Solution" (Alternatively, press Ctrl + Shift + b)

15. Run the program



### Linux Ubuntu 16.04 ###

1. Download a sample C++ program (.cpp file) for running a RealSense camera along with a CMake script (CMakeLists.txt) from https://github.com/ToshiEAB
Note: You need to change the version number "2.10.3" in CMakeLists.txt if you use a different version of RealSense SDK 2.0

2. Make a new folder with the name of your preference (e.g., ~/Documents/sample) and save both of the .cpp and CMakeList.txt files in this folder
Note: Let's call this folder "sample folder" hereafter.

3. Open Terminal and enter the following commands

4. cd ~/Documents/sample
Note: Go to the sample folder

5. mkdir build
Note: Create a new folder named "build"

6. cd build
Note: Go to the build folder

7. cmake ..
Note: Configure C++ program

8. cmake --build . --config Release
Note: Build and compile in Release mode

9. ./RealSense
Note: Run the program
