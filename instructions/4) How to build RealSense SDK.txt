### Windows 8.1/10 ###

<Notes>
The following instructions assume that we will use a C++ compiler associated with Visual Studio.
Thus, you need to install C++ components on Visual Studio if you haven't done it yet.
Also you may need to update the C++ components in order to install an appropriate version of the compiler.  

1. Download the latest version of source code (as a .zip folder) from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases

2. Extract contents of the folder

3. Move the librealsense folder (e.g., librealsense-2.10.3) to the root directory of C drive, that is, C:\

4. Make a new folder named "build" in the librealsense folder

5. Run cmake-gui.exe
Note: This file is located in the CMake folder.

6. Click the "Browse Source..." button and select the opencv folder (e.g., C:/librealsense-2.10.3)

7. Click the "Browse Build..." button and select the build folder (e.g., C:/librealsense-2.10.3/build)

8. Click the "Configure" button

9. Select an appropriate generator (e.g., "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" for a 64-bit OS. "14" means Visual Studio 2015. Check the appropriate number for the version you have.)
Note: Enter "host=x64" under "Optional toolset to use" to allow for the use of the maximum capacity of RAM

10. Click the "Finish" button
Note: After configuration, check-mark "BUILD_WITH_OPENMP" for maximizing the speed of image processing (but it will use the full capacity of CPU)
      Uncheck-mark "BUILD_WITH_OPENMP" for a moderate speed of image processing (The CPU usage will be moderate as well)

11. Click the "Generate" button 

12. Run librealsense.sln located in the build folder
Note: Wait for a minute until parcing completes

13. Change the configuration mode from "Debug" to "Release"
Note: Wait for a minute until parcing completes

14. Build the programs: "Build" tab --> "Build Solution" (Alternatively, press Ctrl + Shift + b)
Note: Wait for a few minutes. This process creates a bunch of new files/folders in the build folder.

15. Set an Environment Variable: 
   a) "Control Panel" --> "System & Security" --> "System" --> "Advanced system settings" --> "Environment Variables" --> Select "Path" under "System variables" --> "Edit"
   b) Add the path where .dll files are located (e.g., C:\librealsense-2.10.3\build\Release)

16. Reboot computer for activating the new Environment Variable



### Linux Ubuntu 16.04 ###

1. Open Terminal

2. sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
Note: This file is necessary for using the RealSense SDK 2.0 on Ubuntu

3. Download the latest version of source code (as a .tar.gz folder) from https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases
Note: Hereafter let's assume that you download librealsense-2.10.3.tar.gz (Replace the version number if you are using a later version).

4. cd ~/Downloads
Note: Go to the Downloads folder

5. mv librealsense-2.10.3.tar.gz ~/Documents/librealsense-2.10.3.tar.gz
Note: Move the file for the Documents folder

6. cd ~/Documents
Note: Go to the Documents folder

7. tar xvzf librealsense-2.10.3.tar.gz
Note: Extract contents of folder

8. cd  librealsense-2.10.3
Note: Go to the new folder

9. mkdir build
Note: Make a new folder named "build"

10. cd build
Note: Go to the build folder

11. cmake ..
Note: Configure librealsense

12. cmake --build . --config Release
Note: Build librealsense in Release mode

13. export PATH="~/Documents/librealsense-2.10.3/build:$PATH"
Note: Set an environment path
